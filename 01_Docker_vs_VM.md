🌐 Docker vs Virtual Machines: A Beginner’s Guide to Navigating MLOps! 🚀

If you’re a beginner exploring MLOps, you’ve probably heard a lot about Virtual Machines (VMs) and Docker. But what exactly are they? And why do experts keep talking about them? Let’s clear the air. 🔍

🚀 Virtualization Demystified:

Virtualization is the backbone of both technologies, but they differ in what they virtualize.

🔧 VMs (Virtual Machines): Virtualize hardware. Each VM has its own OS, kernel, and virtual hardware, managed by a hypervisor.
🐳 Docker Containers: Virtualize the OS kernel. Containers share the host OS kernel while remaining isolated.

🖥️ How Virtual Machines Work:

Operate through a hypervisor (Type 1: Bare-metal, Type 2: Hosted).
Run independent guest OS instances with virtual hardware.
Provide strong isolation through separate OS environments.

📦 How Docker Containers Work:

Use Docker Engine to manage the lifecycle of containers.
Rely on cgroups (resource allocation) and namespaces (isolation).
Share the host OS kernel but maintain isolated environments.

🔍 Core Components Comparison:

VM Components: Hypervisor, Virtual Hardware, Guest OS.
Docker Components: Docker Engine, Docker Images, Docker Files, Docker Containers.

⚡ When to Choose Virtual Machines:

Running multiple OS on a single host.
Strong isolation with independent kernels.
Legacy application support.

⚡ When to Choose Docker Containers:

Microservices architecture (lightweight, fast deployment).
CI/CD pipelines for rapid development.
Resource efficiency with minimal overhead.

📌 Key Takeaway:

Virtual Machines are like having multiple computers in one, each with its own OS. Docker Containers are like lightweight, isolated apps running on the same OS kernel.
